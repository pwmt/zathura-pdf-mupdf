Contributing
============

Development is coordinated entirely via the `issue tracker
<https://bugs.pwmt.org>`_, our `IRC channel <irc://irc.oftc.net/#pwmt>`_ and our
`mailing list <https://lists.pwmt.org>`_. You can send patches to zathura-pdf-mupdf's
mailing list, but pull requests on `github <https://github.com/pwmt/zathura-pdf-mupdf>`_
are preferred.

Here are a few more things you should know and check before you send pull
requests:

* Follow our coding standard
* Document your code
* Write test cases for your code
